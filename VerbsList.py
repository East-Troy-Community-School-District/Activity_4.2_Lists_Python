Instructions:
Read through the code and predict what the
program does. Check your prediction by running the
code. Finally, add two verbs to the list
and have them get printed after the other verbs.
Do you think that the items in a list need to
be printed in order? Test your theory by changing
the code.
What is the length of the list? How can you have
the computer calculate the length of the list?
What index would you use to print the last item
in a list? Does this work if you don't know the
length of the list? How could you print the last
item in the list if you don't know the length of
a list?
